# Format 1:

* We believe [this capability]  
* Will result in [this outcome]
* We will know we have succeeded when [we see a measurable signal]

## Example: We believe personal data will show credit worthiness and enable 75 more coop members to gain access to credit than otherwise could

* We believe personal data such as habbit/behavioral patterns from COTEDEMI business cooperative members will predict creditworthiness and loan repayment.  [personal data]

* Alternative criteria: Church attendance, COTEDEMI attendence, residential stability, payment consistency of microfinanced products, utility payment consistency, proving asset ownership,

* Testing with different COTEDEMI members will provide insight into whether or not criteria is reliable for loan distribution. We will know that we have succedded if we see that x% of COTEDEMI members show a positive and consisten loan repyament based on this alternative criteria.



# Format 2:

* If ____,
* then ____,
* because ____.

Space

* If COTEDEMI members show positive/consistent loan repaymet based on critera being tested

* Then criteria can be considered for future loan 

* Because we will have something to base our assumptions on

# Format 3:

* We believe that [Hypothesis]
* We will do/make [Test]
* We will know the hypothesis is valid if by [Date]
* We get [Evidence: quantitative measurable outcomes] or
* We get [Evidence: qualitative observable outcome]

Space

* We believe that there is a correlation between routine habits/behavioral patters and creditworthiness / repayment of loans. 
* We will do rapid prototyping to test alternative indicators for creditworthiness. 
* We will be doing rapid prototyping in the Dominican Republic/Haiti border.
* We will know our hypothesis is valid when have gathered x number of participants as part of the testing  
* We will get x measurable outcome and x observable outcome


# Format 4:

* I believe [target market]
* will [do this action / use this solution]
* for [this reason]

Space

* I beleive that the target market is willing to provide personal and behavioral data if it may be able to help them get access to loans.

Context/Notes
As A Bank

We want to increase access to capital and provide a way to determine alternative indicators for creditworthiness for Haitian individuals living on the border of the Dominican Republic and Haiti <goal/desire>
So that they can have economic independence and live with dignity. <receive benefit>

We believe that there is a correlation between routine habbits/behavioral patters and creditworthiness / repayment of loans. We will do rapid prototyping to test alternative indicators for creditworthines and Will Know We Have Succeeded when we see a x% of 

A  <this capability>
What functionality we will develop to test our hypothesis? By defining a ‘test’ capability of the product or service that we
are attempting to build, we identify the functionality and hypothesis we want to test.
Will result in <this outcome>
What is the expected outcome of our experiment? What is the specific result we expect to achieve by building the ‘test’
capability?
We will know we have succeeded when <we see a measurable signal>
What signals will indicate that the capability we have built is effective? What key metrics (qualitative or quantitative) we will measure to provide evidence that our experiment has succeeded and give us enough confidence to move to the next stage.

Business Story


We believe that there is a correlation between routine habbits/behavioral patters and creditworthiness / repayment of loans. We will know that we have succeeded when we see that x% of clients tested against the given indicators provde creditworthiness/steady payback.
