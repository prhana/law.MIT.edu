# 1 Scenario: DR/2017

Startup Hypothesis: Using an Automated Business Platform, startup of revolving loan funds can be significatly simplified and streamlined.

* We believe that our human-centered design approached will simplify and streamline the processes of lending to entrepreneurs and start ups living on the Haiti/DR border. Building a system based on the relevant business, legal and technical dimensions of a loan fund in this region will benefit Women's Business Cooperative COTEDEMI, in their ability to test and give feedback to this "launch-ready" fund.
* Loan officers or staff can test the  portal for applicants and borrowers, data and applications, financial accounting and systems logging, etc againt current fund systems operating on the DR/Haiti border.
* Our desired result is to provide a more effiient, data driven loan funding system to entrepreneurs and startups on the Haiti/DR border. 

Startup Hypothesis: Using an Automated Business Platform, startup of revolving loan funds can be significatly simplified and streamlined.

Formation of a legal entity (short term: likely a Delaware LLC) that can enter contracts, sue and be sued, own a depository account to house loan funds and to make other payments (taxes & fees, web services, etc)...
Set up the loan fund online with portal for applicants and borrowers, loan officers or staff, data and applications, financial accounting and systems logging, etc



* Operations: This system will help loan funders more efficiently and effectively operate their businesses while also capturing the necessary data for subsequent loans

* Origination: We believe that social physics data can be use as an alternative indicator for determining creditworthiness (including regular social habits)

# 3 Testing: 

* Startup: We can test this againt current and past systems operating on the DR/Haiti border

* Operations: User testing with COTEDEMI as the first loan fund organizations to lend and use the platform we will gather feedback for next version

* Origination: We will do testing with two groups over a period of time to measure and prove coorelations between alternative indicators prove and creditworthienss

# 4 Desired Results: to have a more clear understanding of creditworthienss for underbanked individuals and use this information for loan decision making proces 

* Startup: Our desired result is to provie more effiient, and data driven loan funding to entrepreneurs and startups on the Haiti/DR border. 

* Operations: We hope to enable groups living on the border to manage and distribute loans in an easy and efficient way and to have them test the system to see if it works

* Origination: We hope to gather enough information to know which alternative indicators for processing loans.
