# 1 Scenario: DR/2017

# Startup Hypothesis: Using an Automated Business Platform, startup of revolving loan funds can be significatly simplified and streamlined.

* We believe that our human-centered design approached will simplify and streamline the lending process to entrepreneurs and start-ups residing on the Haiti/DR border. Building a modular system based on interchangeable business, legal and technical components relative to location/needs of the loan fund, will be helpful in the evolution and replicability of the fund.

Our desired result is to provie more effiient, and data driven loan funding to entrepreneurs and startups on the Haiti/DR border. 

# Operations Hypothesis: Using an Automated Business Platform, management and operations of revolving loan funds can be significatly simplified and streamlined.

* This system will help loan funders more efficiently and effectively operate their businesses by capturing data for determining risk scoring.  

* Our desired result is to build a data driven systesm that facilitates lending autonomy ie. ability to decide payback model/interest rates. We believe that social physics data can be use as an alternative indicator for determining creditworthiness (including regular social habits)

We hope to enable groups living on the border to manage and distribute loans in an easy and efficient way and to have them test the system to see if it works

# Origination Hypothesis: Using an Automated Business Platform, management and operations of revolving loan funds can be significatly simplified and streamlined.

We hope to gather enough information to know which alternative indicators for processing loans.

# Testing: 

* Startup: We can test this against current systems running on the DR/Haiti border

* Operations: User testing Women's Business Cooperative, COTEDEMI, pilot organization to lend and use the platform. We can gather feedback for next version

* Origination: We will do testing with two groups over a period of time to measure and prove coorelations between alternative indicators and creditworthienss.

# Desired Results: 

* To have a more clear understanding of creditworthienss for underbanked individuals and use this information for loan decision making proces
